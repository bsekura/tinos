This is TINOS source code snapshot. This file contains some instructions
and status information. I recommend you read this file to get a general
understanding what you can do with the current snapshot. Please note that
this is unfinished, ongoing work that is not suitable for any serious usage.

This is free software. You can freely use its source code or portions of it 
(unless it is derived from another work in which case original license 
conditions apply) in unchanged or modified form under the condition that you
will maintain a copyright message in the header of the file. I also
specifically require that you sent me an e-mail saying "hello" and sharing
your thougths about the project.

Getting started
---------------

To boot TINOS you need to have grub bootloader. You can download it from
http://www.uruk.org/grub. You won't need to fiddle with your disk's boot
sector, a bootable floppy with grub will do.

Assuming you have grub, you need to either add the following lines to your
grub config file, or type them after booting from grub floppy:

root=(hd0,0)
kernel=/home/beavis/tinos/kernel
boot

The first line tells grub what partition it should use to load kernel image,
the second specifies a path to it, and the third one starts the kernel.
Instead of "hd0,0" and "/home/beavis/tinos/kernel" you should provide
appriopriate values according to your environment. TINOS kernel image
can be found in /tinos/bin/kernel.

You should be seing a TINOS kernel console prompt by now. If that's not
the case, please e-mail me describing your problems.

Playing
-------

You can verify now, whether TINOS will talk to your IDE disks. Type "ide".
The list of IDE devices you have on your system should appear. Only disks
are handled as of now (CD-ROMS, and others should appear on the list, 
though). Disk driver is hardcoded to only do read requests, so you
shouldn't worry about screwing your favorite data.

Next, we can try to scan all your disks for partitions. Type "dev". That
should establish simple block device layer by reading all partitions and
dumping them on the screen.

TINOS can handle ext2 filesystem in readonly mode. You can try it by typing
"mount <device_number>", where device number is taken from the "dev" command
above. If the filesystem has been mounted successfully, try "ls". Root
directory should be dumped. You can also do "ls -l" to get more details.
Changing dirs is done via "cd" command, but it's stupid now and takes
an inode number as a parameter (inode number is always printed left to a
file name).

If you have more than one ext2 filesystem, you can try to mount the other
one. The safest is to reboot and repeat the steps above. 

If all of the above worked fine for you or it crashed at some point, please 
drop me a message. It will give me an invaluable feedback to fix the bugs
I wouldn't be able to find for myself.

Thanks for trying TINOS!
